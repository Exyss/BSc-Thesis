This thesis marks the culmination of a long journey, one that I could not have completed without the incredible support and encouragement from the people around me. I am deeply grateful to all who have been part of this process and contributed to this achievement.

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my thesis advisors. Your guidance, expertise and patience have been invaluable.

To my parents, words cannot express how much I owe to you. Thank you for always believing that I could achieve anything and for the countless sacrifices you made to ensure I had the opportunity to succeed. Your belief in me have been the bedrock of my confidence.

To my brother, thank you for being the dual entity in my life, showing me a different perspective and always keeping me grounded. You've taught me to understand my strengths and weaknesses. Your support has always been a unique and irreplaceable part of my journey and I am grateful for the balance you've brought into my life.

To my close friends, thank you for your unwavering loyalty and support over the past years, even through thick and thin. In particular, thanks to those who have been by my side since we were small children and young teenagers. Your friendship has been a constant source of laughter.

To my university colleagues, thank you for making this experience truly unforgettable. The late-night discussions, collaborative problem-solving and shared moments of triumph and struggle have been invaluable. I will always treasure the sense of solidarity and the incredible memories we've built together.

Finally, I extend my deepest thanks to everyone who has contributed to my growth and success throughout this journey, even those who I made suffer. This accomplishment is as much a reflection of your support as it is of my efforts.
