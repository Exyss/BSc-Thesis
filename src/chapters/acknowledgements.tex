This thesis represents the culmination of a long journey, one that would have been impossible to complete without the unwavering support, encouragement, and guidance from the remarkable people around me. I am profoundly grateful to all who played a part in this process and contributed to this achievement.

First and foremost, I would like to express my deepest and most sincere gratitude to my advisors, professors N. Galesi and M. Lauria. Your expert guidance and insightful feedback have been the lantern of this endeavor.

To my parents, no words can capture the depth of my gratitude. Thank you for always believing in my abilities and for the countless sacrifices you made to ensure I had every opportunity to succeed. Your unwavering support has been the foundation upon which my confidence and resilience are built. I owe everything to your love and faith in me.

To my brother, my dual entity in this life: you are my opposite, yet we are inseparably connected. You challenge me, balance me and push me to see the world in ways I never would on my own. You've showed me the other side of the river. I wouldn't be the person I am today without you by my side.

To my friends and university colleagues, your loyalty and unwavering support over the years have been invaluable. Your friendship has been a continuous source of joy, laughter, shared experiences and constant growth. A heartfelt thank you to my closest friends --- Riccardo, Francesco, and Simone. You've been my companions for almost ten years, in both good times and bad, always ready with support. You have been my pillars through thick and thin and I am forever grateful for the memories we've created together.

Finally, to everyone who has contributed to my personal and academic growth along the way --- whether through direct support or quiet encouragement --- thank you. This thesis is the result of not just my efforts, but of the unwavering support and inspiration from those around me. Thank you.
