abstract = {We give a characterization of span program size by a combinatorial-algebraic measure. The measure we consider is a generalization of a measure on covers which has been used to prove lower bounds on formula size and has also been studied with respect to communication complexity.In the monotone case our new methods yield nΩ(log n) lower bounds for the monotone span program complexity of explicit Boolean functions in n variables over arbitrary fields, improving the previous lower bounds on monotone span program size. Our characterization of span program size implies that any matrix with superpolynomial separation between its rank and cover number can be used to obtain superpolynomial lower bounds on monotone span program size. We also identify a property of bipartite graphs that is sufficient for constructing Boolean functions with large monotone span program complexity.},

This implies a superpolynomial (nΩ(log n)) lower bound on the size of any monotone formula for st-connectivity.The proof draws intuition from a new characterization of circuit depth in terms of communication complexity. It uses counting arguments and Extremal Set Theory.Within the same framework, we also give a very simple and intuitive proof of a depth analogue of a theorem of Krapchenko concerning formula size lower bounds.},
