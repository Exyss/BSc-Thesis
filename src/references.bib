abstract = {We give a characterization of span program size by a combinatorial-algebraic measure. The measure we consider is a generalization of a measure on covers which has been used to prove lower bounds on formula size and has also been studied with respect to communication complexity.In the monotone case our new methods yield nΩ(log n) lower bounds for the monotone span program complexity of explicit Boolean functions in n variables over arbitrary fields, improving the previous lower bounds on monotone span program size. Our characterization of span program size implies that any matrix with superpolynomial separation between its rank and cover number can be used to obtain superpolynomial lower bounds on monotone span program size. We also identify a property of bipartite graphs that is sufficient for constructing Boolean functions with large monotone span program complexity.},

This implies a superpolynomial (nΩ(log n)) lower bound on the size of any monotone formula for st-connectivity.The proof draws intuition from a new characterization of circuit depth in terms of communication complexity. It uses counting arguments and Extremal Set Theory.Within the same framework, we also give a very simple and intuitive proof of a depth analogue of a theorem of Krapchenko concerning formula size lower bounds.},

abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},
